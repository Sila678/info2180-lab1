        <h2>Sutania Lewis</h2>
        <p>I am doing a double major in Computer Science and French.  I am interested in Web Development because I want to learn how to make websites and apps for myself.  I always see well developed websites and decided that I should know how to make one for myself.  I also see where some websites do not look pleasing to the eye, and I can find a career in fixing these sites.</p>
